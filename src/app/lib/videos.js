                "description": "In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPain modulates dopamine neurons via a spinal–parabrachial–mesencephalic circuit: https://go.nature.com/3FPaFIH\nDopamine, Updated: Reward Prediction Error and Beyond: https://bit.ly/3Gha0A7\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nEffect of tyrosine on cognitive function and blood pressure under stress: https://bit.ly/3LSSHZq\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/3LSgCZ6\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3TIWfj2\n\nOther Resources\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dopamine\n00:02:32 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous\n00:06:27 Dopamine Brain Circuits \n00:14:53 Goals & Addiction\n00:17:13 Dopamine Dynamics, “Wave Pool” analogy\n00:20:28 Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n00:28:26 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:40 Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, “Scoreboard”\n00:37:40 Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n00:44:55 Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n00:50:43 Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n00:53:25 Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n01:02:08 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:26 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:09:38 Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:18:58 Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n01:23:31 Dopamine Dynamics, “Dopamine Stacking”; Intrinsic Motivation\n01:38:10 Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n01:41:49 Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n01:52:16 Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n01:57:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.
